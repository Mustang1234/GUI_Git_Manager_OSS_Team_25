# GUI_Git_Manager_OSS_Team_25



## Project Description
Our project is a git browser that adds a git function to the file browser, tkfilebrowser.</br>
(version1:tag v1) In addition to the existing file browsing function, simple git functions were additionally implemented so that a git repository could be created locally and projects could be carried out using git.</br>
(version2:tag v2) Also, the file browser was upgraded to make git work easier by adding the Branch management function, the ability to show commit history using the git log button, and the git clone function.

The language was implemented using python.


## How to Execute

- The following execution methods are based on Windows 10.
- The project was implemented as of Python 3.11.
- The program was implemented in Visual Studio Code.


#### Install and prepare execution
1. Go to the GUI_Git_Manager_OSS_Team_25 repository and press the Code -> Download ZIP button to download and extract the file wherever you want.
2. Install Git from here! https://git-scm.com/
3. Install python 3.11 including pip. (If you don't do custom, pip is usually installed automatically.)
4. Turn on the cmd window
- ```pip install tkfilebrowser```
- ```pip install pywin32```
- ```pip install configparser```

</br>Download the required files by entering the commands in turn.  (If there is a problem, please solve it through ["Reference in case of a problem"](#Reference-in-case-of-a-problem) 1 and 2.)



#### How to run
1. In Visual Studio Code, Open Folder -> open the downloaded file from Git Repository -> select \GUI_Git_Manager_OSS_Team_25\tkFileBrowser to open it.
2. (Prepare to run Python in VS code)Extensions -> Search Python -> Python (2023.8.0) install.
3. There are four folders in Explorer: docs, tests, tkfilebrowser, and tkfilebrowser_custom. Open \_\_main\_\_.py in the tkfilebrowser_custom folder.
4. Run as Ctrl+F5 or run -> run without debugging.


#### How to use
##### 1) File Browser Features
Double-click a folder: You have entered that folder.</br>
Click File: Status to write git function to that file.

##### 2) git function
###### 1. git init
: The button is active where the .git folder does not exist.
  
- how to use? Press the git init button while in the folder where I want to create the git repository (the folder where I want to write the git init command).
  
- Caution: You must double-click the folder in which you want to create the Git repository. A single click will execute the command to the current folder, the parent folder of the clicked folder, so you must double-click to enter it and press the button. Also, like the original git, it's possible for our program to go side by side from one folder where the .git folder is located to create a .git, but I don't recommend using this. This is because the expressions of upper .git and lower .git are ambiguous due to the nature of gui implementation.

###### 2. git add

- how to use? Press the git add button within a folder containing the .git directory

- If you click on a file in the "modified" or "untracked" state and press the git add button, only the clicked file will be added using the "git add ".
If you press git add without selecting a file, it will perform the git add . feature, adding all files in the folder. (First, it will ask through a message window if you want to add all files, and if you choose "yes," it will perform git add.)


###### 3. git commit
: The button is active when you click on a file in the "staged" state.

- how to use? After entering the git repository (the folder with the .git), click on any file in the "staged" state and press the commit button. This will bring up a dialog box showing the staged changes and asking if you want to commit the changes in the staging area.
  - Press the "yes" button to proceed. A commit message window will appear, where you should enter the commit message, and then press the OK button.
  - If you don't enter a commit message, an error message will be displayed.
  - If you don't want to commit while the commit message window is open, you can simply press the Cancel button to exit the window.

- Note: The default option for committing (git commit -m) commits all the files in the staging area at once. The feature to selectively commit specific files is not implemented in this case. Therefore, even if you click on a specific file and press the commit button, if there are other added files, they will be committed together.

###### 4. git restore

: The button is active when you click on a file in the "modified" state.

- how to use? If you click on a file that has modifications and press the git restore button, it will revert the changes made to the file, effectively undoing the modifications made since the last commit. The file will transition from the "modified" state to the "unmodified" state, representing the state it was in at the latest commit.

###### 5. git restore â€”staged
: The button is active when you click on a file in the "staged" state.

- how to use? If you click on a file that has been added (in the staged state) but you want to revert it back to the state before the add operation, pressing the button will undo the git add operation. The file will transition from the "staged" state to the "modified" state.

###### 6. git mv

- How to use? If you click on a file within a folder that contains the .git directory and press the git_mv button, you can change the name or path of the selected file.

###### 7. git rm

- How to use? If you click on a file within a folder that contains the .git directory and press the git_rm button, the selected file will be removed from the Git repository.

###### 8. git rm --cached Button

- how to use? If you click on a file that is in the staged or committed state within a folder that contains the .git directory and then press the "git rm --cached" button, the selected file will be executed by the corresponding functionality.

###### 9. Buttons related to the git status function

- how to use?  When you enter a file or folder within a Git repository, the status of the file or folder is displayed using the Git status column. Pressing the "git status" button will sort the Git status entries. Clicking the "update_status" button in the upper-right corner will refresh the displayed statuses.

###### 10. Implementing button activation based on the Git status

- how to use? This function displays buttons based on the status of the selected file or folder. When you select a file or enter a folder, the corresponding buttons will appear based on the current state of the file or folder, according to the Git functionalities mentioned above.

###### 11.Branch create

- how to use? When you click the Branch button in the Git repository, a Git Branch Function window with five Git functions will appear. Here, click the Create Branch button. A small message window will appear, allowing you to enter a new branch name. After entering the name, click the OK button.

- If the operation is successful, a message window will appear, the branch creation function will be executed, and the Git Branch Function window will close.
If a Git error occurs, such as an inappropriate branch name, an error message window will appear, and the branch creation function will not be executed.
Caution: Do not start the branch name with "-".

###### 12.Branch checkout

- how to use? When you click the Checkout Branch button in the Git Branch Function window, it opens the checkout branch window that displays the branches. Click on the local branch you want to checkout. A message will appear indicating which branch you have checked out, and both the Git Branch Function window and the checkout branch window will close. Additionally, the contents of the tkbrowser's folder and the label indicating the current branch name in red will automatically refresh based on the branch that was checkout. The current branch label always showed within a git repository.

###### 13. Branch delete

- how to use? When you click the Branch button and then the Delete button, it displays a list of branches. Select the local branch you want to delete (optionally, there may be a feature to show remote branches as well). If the deletion is successful, a success message will appear.

###### 14. Branch rename

- how to use? When you click the Branch button and then the Rename button, it displays a list of branches. Select the local branch you want to rename. If the renaming is successful, a success message will appear.
  - If the branch name violates the naming rules such as containing spaces, question marks, asterisks, or other prohibited characters, an error message will be displayed to indicate the issue.
  - It is not recommended to start the branch name with a hyphen (-) as it can be confused with command options. In such cases, the error message will provide guidelines on proper usage.

###### 15. Branch merge

- how to use? After clicking the "Branch" button, press the "Merge" button to display a list of branch options. Select the desired local branch that you wish to merge.
  - If the merge is successful, a success message will be displayed.
  - If the contents of the current branch are the same as the branch you want to merge (if the merge has already been made, no changes have been made to merge, or you have selected the same branch as the current branch), the message window "Already up-to-date" is displayed.
  - If you attempt to merge without committing your changes, an error message will be displayed along with the name of the file that requires saving.
  - In the case of a merge conflict, a message will be displayed prompting you to attempt the merge again. Before proceeding with the merge, the system will automatically revert to the state before the merge using the command `git merge --abort`. The unmerged paths will be displayed in a new window. By inspecting the unmerged paths, you can identify where the conflict occurred. You can then navigate to the problematic file, make the necessary modifications to resolve the conflict, and click the button again to proceed with the merge.

###### 17. Git Log

- how to use? In the Git repository, the 'Log' button is enabled, and when clicked, it displays the logs of the repository. The logs are generated by the log function and include a graph, commit messages. To view the detailed information of each commit, you can click on a button labeled with a 7-character commit checksum. If there are no commits, it will display "No commits exist."


###### 18. Git Clone

- how to use? Click the clone button in the folder where you want to clone the repository. Please enter the HTTPS address you want to clone. (Repository's HTTPS address : Press the <>code button and copy the https address in Github.) Once you enter it, a window will appear asking whether the repository is public. Press "Yes" to "public" or "No" to "private". If it's private, you'll need to enter the  personal access token for the clone to proceed. 
- Note: You can enter an address that contains .git or an address that does not contain .git.</br>
(example: Both "https://github.com/Mustang1234/GUI_Git_Manager_OSS_Team_25.git" and "https://github.com/Mustang1234/GUI_Git_Manager_OSS_Team_25" is possible.)

- The config.ini file, which contains the ID and token information, will be stored in the User or root directory.
